# KU Polls: Online Survey Questions 
[![unittest-results](https://github.com/TeerapatTrepopsakulsin/ku-polls/actions/workflows/unittest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TeerapatTrepopsakulsin/ku-polls/actions/workflows/unittest.yml)

An application to conduct online polls and surveys written in Python and based
on the [Django Tutorial project](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/) that lets everyone see the results of a poll question, but only authenticated users can submit or change their own vote, with a limit of one vote per user forÂ every poll. Furthermore, each poll question has its own voting period, during which users can submit or change their votes for the poll, but the poll will always be visible after it has been published even after it voting period has passed.

This app was created as part of the [Individual Software Process](
https://cpske.github.io/ISP) course at [Kasetsart University](https://www.ku.ac.th).
